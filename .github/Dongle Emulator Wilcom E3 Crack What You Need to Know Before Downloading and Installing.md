Wilcom E3 is a powerful embroidery software that allows you to create, edit, and digitize embroidery designs with ease. However, to use Wilcom E3, you need a dongle, which is a small device that plugs into your computer and acts as a security key. A dongle can be easily lost, damaged, or stolen, which can prevent you from accessing your embroidery software and files.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution: a dongle emulator. A dongle emulator is a software program that mimics the function of a dongle, allowing you to run Wilcom E3 without the physical device. A dongle emulator can also help you to backup your dongle data, share your dongle with multiple computers, or use Wilcom E3 on a virtual machine.
