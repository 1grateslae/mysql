In this article, we will answer these questions and more, and show you how to get the most out of this innovative learning tool.
 
## What is Aikido 3D 2.0 Full?
 
Aikido 3D 2.0 Full is the latest version of Aikido 3D, a software program that was first released in 2004 by BodyMind and Voice Inc., a company founded by David Halprin, a 6th dan aikido instructor and former student of Morihiro Saito Sensei. Aikido 3D 2.0 Full is designed to teach you the basics of aikido, as well as advanced techniques and principles, using realistic 3D animations and interactive features. You can choose from over 150 techniques, covering all levels of difficulty and all attack scenarios, such as grabs, strikes, kicks, multiple attackers, and weapons. You can also customize your learning experience by selecting your preferred style of aikido (Aikikai or Iwama), your preferred language (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, or Japanese), and your preferred viewing angle (front, side, top, or free). You can also adjust the speed and zoom of the animations, and access detailed information on each technique, such as the name, meaning, history, tips, common mistakes, variations, and applications.

## How does Aikido 3D 2.0 Full work?
 
Aikido 3D 2.0 Full works by using a combination of motion capture technology and computer graphics to create realistic and accurate representations of aikido techniques. The motion capture data was recorded from real aikido practitioners performing the techniques in a studio with multiple cameras and sensors. The computer graphics were then applied to create lifelike models of the human body and the dojo environment. The result is a high-quality 3D animation that shows you every detail of the movement and posture of both the attacker (uke) and the defender (nage). You can watch the animation from any angle and distance, pause it at any point, rewind it or fast-forward it, and even switch roles between uke and nage.
 
But Aikido 3D 2.0 Full is not just a passive viewing tool. It also allows you to interact with the animation and get feedback from a virtual instructor. You can use your mouse or keyboard to control the movement of uke or nage, and see how different actions affect the outcome of the technique. You can also use your microphone to speak commands to uke or nage, such as "attack", "stop", "relax", or "resist". The virtual instructor will then respond accordingly and give you verbal guidance on how to improve your performance. You can also ask questions to the virtual instructor about any aspect of the technique or aikido in general.
 
## What are the benefits of using Aikido 3D 2.0 Full?
 
Aikido 3D 2.0 Full is not meant to replace actual training in a dojo with a qualified instructor and partner. However, it can be a very useful supplement to your regular practice, especially if you have limited access to a dojo or want to review what you have learned at your own pace. Some of the benefits of using Aikido 3D 2.0 Full are:

- It can help you improve your visual perception and spatial awareness.
