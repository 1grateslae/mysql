1. The movie's director, James Cameron, was so fascinated by the Titanic that he made 12 dives to the shipwreck site and spent more time there than the actual passengers did. He also recreated the ship's interiors with meticulous accuracy, using original blueprints and photographs. He even hired experts to teach the actors how to use period-appropriate manners and language[^1^] [^2^].
2. The movie's most famous line, \"I'm the king of the world!\", was not in the script. Leonardo DiCaprio improvised it on the spot during filming, and James Cameron liked it so much that he kept it in the final cut[^1^].
3. The movie's soundtrack, composed by James Horner, features vocals by Norwegian singer Sissel KyrkjebÃƒÂ¸. The theme song, \"My Heart Will Go On\", sung by Celine Dion, became one of the best-selling singles of all time and won four Grammy Awards. However, James Cameron initially did not want to include any songs in the movie, and Celine Dion was reluctant to record it. She only agreed to do one take, which ended up being used for the final version[^2^] [^3^].
4. The movie's cast included several actors who played real-life Titanic passengers or crew members. For example, Bernard Hill played Captain Edward Smith, Victor Garber played Thomas Andrews, the ship's builder, Jonathan Hyde played J. Bruce Ismay, the chairman of White Star Line, and David Warner played Spicer Lovejoy, Cal's bodyguard. Some of the minor characters were also based on real people, such as Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), John Jacob Astor IV (Eric Braeden), and Benjamin Guggenheim (Michael Ensign)[^2^] [^3^].
5. The movie's production faced many challenges and difficulties. The filming took place in a giant water tank in Mexico, where the weather was often hot and humid. The actors had to endure long hours in cold water, wearing heavy costumes and makeup. Many of them suffered from hypothermia, dehydration, or kidney infections. The crew also had to deal with technical malfunctions, budget overruns, and schedule delays. James Cameron was known for being demanding and perfectionist, often clashing with the studio executives and the cast[^2^] [^3^].

Despite all these hardships, Titanic became a huge success and a cultural phenomenon. It received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, and won numerous awards and accolades. It also inspired many people to learn more about the Titanic's history and legacy. Titanic is a movie that will never be forgotten.
