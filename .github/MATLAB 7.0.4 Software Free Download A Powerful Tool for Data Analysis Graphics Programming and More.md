# How to Download MATLAB 7.0.4 for Free
 
MATLAB is a popular programming and numeric computing platform used by millions of engineers and scientists to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models. MATLAB stands for **matrix laboratory**, since it allows users to manipulate matrices, plot data, and design user interfaces. MATLAB also includes a toolbox with the MuPAD engine that enables symbolic computation capabilities.

If you are looking for a way to download MATLAB 7.0.4 for free, you may be disappointed to know that MATLAB is not a free software. MATLAB is a paid product developed by MathWorks, and you need a license to use it. However, there are some options that may help you access MATLAB 7.0.4 without paying for it.
 
- Check if your school provides access to MATLAB through a campus-wide license. Many universities and colleges offer MATLAB and Simulink to their students for free or at a discounted price. You can use your school email address to sign in to MathWorks and download MATLAB 7.0.4 from there.
- Request a trial version of MATLAB from MathWorks. You can fill out a form on their website and request a free trial of MATLAB for 30 days. You will need to provide some information about yourself and your intended use of MATLAB. You will also need to create a MathWorks account and verify your email address.
- Use an alternative software that is similar to MATLAB but free or open source. There are several programs that can perform similar tasks as MATLAB, such as Octave, Scilab, R, Python, and Julia. These programs may have different syntaxes and features than MATLAB, but they can also handle matrices, plot data, and run scripts.

We hope this article helped you find a way to download MATLAB 7.0.4 for free or at a low cost. Remember that MATLAB is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you with your academic or professional projects, but it is also a proprietary software that requires a license to use legally.
  
If you decide to use MATLAB 7.0.4, you may wonder what are some of the features and capabilities of this version. MATLAB 7.0.4 was released in September 2005 and it introduced some new functions and enhancements to the existing ones. Some of the highlights of MATLAB 7.0.4 are:
