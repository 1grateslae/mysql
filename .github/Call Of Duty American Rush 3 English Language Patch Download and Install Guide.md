# How to Play Call of Duty: American Rush 3 in English
 
Call of Duty: American Rush 3 is a single-player game based on the original Call of Duty engine. It was released in 2015 by bewoo, a modder who created a new campaign with custom maps, weapons, and enemies. The game is set in World War II and follows the American soldiers as they fight against the Nazis in Europe and Africa.
 
However, the game has a problem: it is only available in Russian. The modder did not include an English language option or patch for the game. This means that many players who are interested in the game cannot enjoy it fully because they cannot understand the dialogue, menus, or objectives.
